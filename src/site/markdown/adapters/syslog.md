Boundary Syslog Route
=====================

The Syslog route nables the UDP receipt of forwarded syslog messagesg daemon into Boundary events.

This adapters adheres to standard set forth in [RFC 3164](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164).

Configuration
-------------

### Forwarding Syslog Messages

The Syslog Event Route requires that syslog messages be forwarded:

* Using the `UDP` transport
* Sent in the RFC 3164 format.

There are various open source and commericial implementations of syslog including:

* `syslogd`
* [Kiwi Syslog](http://www.kiwisyslog.com)
* [RSYSLOG](http://www.rsyslog.com)
* [syslog-ng](http://www.syslog-ng.org)

The syslog implementations liste above have the capability to forward syslog messages using UDP and syslog format (RFC 3164).

The configuration to forward syslog messages typically in this format:

```
*.*     @<hostname>:<port>

```

NOTE: Different implementations have different names for the configuration file location (typically `/etc/syslog.conf` or `/etc/rsylog.conf`),
consult the documentation for your implementation to determine the path to the configuration file.

For example if the Boundary Event SDK was running on the host `ren.stimpy.com` and the Syslog adapter parameter `port` was configured to _1514_
then the typical syslog configuration to forward _all_ of the syslog messages would be the following:

```
*.*    @ren.stimpy.com:1514
```

If only a subset of the syslog messages are to be forwarded this possible by combined filtering using _facility_ or _severity_. Examples below
show only a subset of syslog messages:

Forward all syslog messages of severity of `info` to the Boundary Event SDK on the host _192.168.0.1_ on port _1514_.

```
*.info @192.168.0.1:1514
```

Forward all `daemon` syslog messages to the Boundary Event SDK on the _localhost_ on port _10514_:

```
daemon.*          @127.0.0.1:10514
```
### Aggregating Syslog Messages

It is good practice to designate a system or systems to be serve the role as _loghost_. The loghost
is responsible for aggregating the syslog messages sent from other hosts and then forwarding the required
subset to the Syslog Message route which is co-located on the same host.
Systems that are to forward Syslog messsage should be configured to forward messages using
TCP rather than. Most modern implementations of Syslog allow forwarding of message via TCP. Consult your
deployed Syslog implementation documentation for exact details and configuration on how to forward syslog messages via TCP.

### Parameters

These parameters that application in the `etc/event-application.xml` file.

* `bindAddress` - Address to bind the socket to, defaults to 0.0.0.0
* `port` - Port number to listen for Syslog message (default is 1514).
* `routeId` - Name of the route instance appears in logs.
* `startOrder` - Ordering of when this route is started in relationship to other routes.
* `toUri` - Indicates the end point to send the transformed syslog message.

### Example Configuration
```
<bean id="syslog-route" class="com.boundary.sdk.event.syslog.SysLogRouteBuilder">
   <property name="routeId" value="SYSLOG"/>
   <property name="startUpOrder" value="120"/>
   <property name="port" value="1514"/>
   <property name="toUri" value="seda:boundary-event"/>
</bean>
```

Event Mapping
----------------------------------------
This section describes the mapping of the Syslog message to a Boundary event.

A syslog message consists of the following fields:

* Facility
* Hostname/IP Address
* Severity
* Message
* Timestamp

### Field Mapping

The table below provides a guide of how the Syslog message fields are mapped to a Boundary event.

|Syslog Field  |Boundary Event Field     |Boundary Field Type|Boundary Fingerprint Field?|Boundary Tag?|
|--------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------:|
|facility      | facility                | property          | YES                       | YES         |
|timestamp     | createdAt               | standard          | NO                        | NO          |
|message       | message                 | standard/property | YES                       | NO          |
|hostname      | source.ref              | standard/property | YES                       | YES         |
|              | source.type             | standard          | YES                       | YES         |
|severity      | severity(mapped)        | standard          | NO                        | NO          |
|severity      | status(mapped)          | standard          | NO                        | NO          |
|              | title (text + hostname) | standard          | NO                        | NO          |


### Severity Mapping
Mapping of Syslog severity to Boundary event severity is given by the table below. Mapping can be customized by modification of a
java property file (`BOUNDARY_SDK_HOME/syslog/etc/syslog.severity.properties`).

|Syslog Severity|Boundary Event Severity|
|---------------|-----------------------|
|EMERG          |CRITICAL               |
|ALERT          |CRITICAL               |
|CRIT           |CRITICAL               |
|ERR            |ERROR                  |
|WARNING        |WARNING                |
|NOTICE         |INFO                   |
|INFO           |INFO                   |
|DEBUG          |INFO                   |

### Status Mapping
Boundary event status of a syslog message is determined by the Syslog severity. The table below shows the default mapping, which  customized by modification of a
java property file (`BOUNDARY_SDK_HOME/syslog/etc/syslog.status.properties`).

|Syslog Severity|Boundary Event Status|
|---------------|---------------------|
|EMERG          |OPEN                 |
|ALERT          |OPEN                 |
|CRIT           |OPEN                 |
|ERR            |OPEN                 |
|WARNING        |OPEN                 |
|NOTICE         |OK                   |
|INFO           |OK                   |
|DEBUG          |OK                   |

Future Enhancements
-------------------
* Generalized mapping and transformation of Syslog message fields to Boundary event fields
* Support for syslog format as specified by [RFC 5424](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424)
